# Books MVP

1. **Ticket #101 - Code Documentation Enhancement**

   - **User Story**: As a developer, I want to have clear comments on each function, so that I can understand the codebase more quickly and maintain it efficiently.
   - **Task**: Add descriptive comments to each function across the codebase to enhance readability and facilitate easier maintenance.

2. **Ticket #102 - Refactor Books.js to Use Custom Hook**

   - **User Story**: As a developer, I want to use the `useAxios` custom hook in `Books.js` to streamline HTTP requests, ensuring a consistent approach to data fetching.
   - **Task**: Replace the current `axios.get` function in `Books.js` with the `useAxios` custom hook without altering the existing functionality.

3. **Ticket #103 - Implement Search in Books.js**

   - **User Story**: As a user, I want to search for books by title, author, or genre, so that I can find specific books more easily in the application.
   - **Task**: Add a search feature in `Books.js` to enable users to filter and find books based on various criteria.

4. **Ticket #104 - Fix Message Display Timing in AddBook.js**

   - **User Story**: As a user, I want to clearly see success or error messages for a sufficient amount of time, so that I can understand the outcome of my actions.
   - **Task**: Modify `AddBook.js` to ensure that success/error messages are displayed for the full 5000 milliseconds as defined in the `useAxios` hook.

5. **Ticket #105 - Image URL Fallback Implementation**

   - **User Story**: As a user, I want to see a default image for books where no image URL is provided, so that the user interface remains consistent and visually appealing.
   - **Task**: Implement a check in `AddBook.js` to use a default image when a user does not provide an image URL.

6. **Ticket #106 - Develop SinglePage Component**

   - **6.1. User Story (Route and Links)**: As a user, I want to navigate to a detailed page for each book, so I can view more information about it.
     - **Task**: Set up a new route and navigation links for the `SinglePage` component.
   - **6.2. User Story (Styling Consistency)**: As a user, I expect the SinglePage component to have a consistent look and feel with the rest of the application for a seamless experience.
     - **Task**: Use Material-UI for designing the `SinglePage` component, ensuring it aligns with the existing style of the application.

7. Create a cartSlice.js that looks almost the same as productSlice.js

It will not have any getProduct in it, or any extra Reducers, these should be empty.
It should contain an empty array in initialState that is called cart: []
It will not have an additional logic in there at the moment.
You will then need to connect this to the store, and check it in the redux dev tools of your chrome browser
